I made this app to order beverages by clicking few buttons. So first of all when a user is going to open the app he will see the
welcome page with our logo which is JainShop for 3 seconds and then an instruction page will be open which tells the user how to
use the app and after that user can click on the button below to enter the next activity in which user can see list of items like
Hot chocolate, ice tea etc, with their prices. User can also increse or decrease the quantity of drinks by his on will, after all that
user can click on checkout button below the items to go for review the order. Now users see the last activity in which user can see 
price of the drinks he brought before taxes and also after including taxes, which includes the TVQ and TSP and user can enjoy the service,
with a Thankyou message in the buttom.
